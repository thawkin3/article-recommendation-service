# Article Recommendation Service

This app is built using Python 3.9+, Flask 2.0+, and Pinecone. It performs a similarity search using the Pinecone SDK to find articles that are similar to ones you've read in the past.

## Running the app locally

Begin by cloning this git repo and navigating to the project directory.

Next, create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies by running:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create an `.env` file and add your Pinecone API key:

```
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Finally, to run the app on your machine, simply run this command from the terminal:

```
flask run
```

Or, to run the app in debug mode, add the `FLASK_ENV=development` environment variable before the command:

```
FLASK_ENV=development flask run
```

The app should now be running on http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
